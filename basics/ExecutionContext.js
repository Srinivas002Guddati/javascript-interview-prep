// Global Execution Context starts here
var x = 10;

function multiply(num) {
  // Function Execution Context starts when multiply is called

var output = multiply(x); // Function Execution Context is created
console.log("Output:", output); // Output: 20


/*
- When the script runs, the Global Execution Context (GEC) is created.
- Variables x, multiply, and output are hoisted.
- When multiply(x) is called:
- A Function Execution Context (FEC) is created for multiply
- num is assigned 10
- result is calculated and returned
- After execution, the FEC is popped off the call stack
